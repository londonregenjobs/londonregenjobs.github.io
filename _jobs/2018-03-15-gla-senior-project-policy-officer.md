London is a city of rich diversity. To ensure London remains a beacon of diversity, the city needs to be inclusive of every Londoner. This is the Mayor of London’s vision – for an inclusive London.

This is a fantastic opportunity to join a growing team at London’s City Hall that is working to make this vision a reality. The Greater London Authority is recruiting a senior project and policy officer to work in the communities and social policy unit. The successful candidate will play a key role in implementing the Mayor’s equality, diversity and inclusion strategy – a strategy that sets out how in all his policies and programmes, the Mayor will work to address the long-standing inequalities and discrimination that Londoners can experience.

You will play a lead role in working across the full range of Mayoral teams and bodies, supporting them to realise the benefits of London’s diversity by promoting equality of opportunity and the diverse needs and aspirations of London’s communities.

You will have proven experience in a social policy role, preferably in the field of equality, diversity and inclusion. Experience of working with BAME communities or on issues that particularly affect BAME communities would also be an advantage. We are looking for applicants with strong strategic thinking skills and an ability to communicate and influence effectively.

London's diversity is its biggest asset and we strive to ensure our workforce reflects London's diversity at all levels. We welcome applications from everyone regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith or disability.

We are committed to being an inclusive employer and we are happy to consider flexible working arrangements. This is a part time role (22.2 hours). There is flexibility on days worked (Monday – Friday).

This role is specifically being offered on a part-time, job share basis. In addition to a good salary package, we offer an attractive range of benefits including 30 days’ annual leave, interest free season ticket loan, tenancy deposit loans, interest free bicycle loan, childcare voucher scheme and a career average pension scheme.

If you have a question about the role or the recruitment process then please contact a member of the recruitment team via email on glajobs@london.gov.uk quoting reference GLA1590.
