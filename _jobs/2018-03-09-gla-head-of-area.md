Inspire excellence as you deliver innovative solutions.

Tackling the housing crisis is the Mayor’s top priority and as Head of Area for North East London you will be responsible for delivering the Mayor’s multi-billion pound affordable housing investment programmes across nine of London’s boroughs and with a wide range of investment partners.  Leading your Homes for Londoners team and working with the wider GLA and the Mayoral family - including Transport for London - you will ensure that partners have the support  they need to develop their housing and regeneration ambitions. You will take responsibility for achieving demanding affordable housing targets and will seek out fresh opportunities for development, including through the Mayor’s new £250m Land Fund. 

As a member of the Homes for Londoners senior management team this role is perfectly suited to a dynamic individual who can provide clear leadership, generate successful senior level networks and drive change. With a strong track record of delivery in the housing sector, you will have highly developed strategic, analytical, project management and planning skills. You will thrive under pressure whilst providing clear support to your team. It goes without saying that you will have exceptional communication skills, with the ability to identify influential contacts and develop solutions that are mutually beneficial.  

Working very closely with the Mayor’s office and senior colleagues at City Hall, this role offers huge scope to influence housing policy and practice at a strategic level in the world’s greatest city and we are seeking an individual with the flair, energy and skills to go beyond their core delivery responsibilities.  If you can demonstrate that ambition, and the track record to support it then we would like to hear from you.

If that’s an environment that you think you’d enjoy working in, then we’d be delighted to talk about our future collaborations.
