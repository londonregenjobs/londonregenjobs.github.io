An opportunity has arisen to work within our busy Planning Specialists Team on matters related to heritage, conservation and urban design within the borough.

You will provide specialist design and conservation advice for developers, agents and owners of historic buildings and structures to ensure that we sustain and enhance the character of the borough, and improve the built environment for our residents and visitors alike. The role also provides the opportunity to become involved with a wide range of heritage projects and policy work, and to work with many different external groups and organisations.

You will have a degree in planning or in a related discipline but with a sound knowledge of planning legislation and policies. You will also have an additional qualification in conservation of the built environment. Membership of the IHBC is desirable.

In addition to this, you will need to have a very good knowledge of historic buildings from the 16th to the 20th centuries, their development, materials, the design principles involved in their extension and alteration and the techniques necessary for their repair. You will have excellent communication skills, verbal and written and experience of researching and writing documents to a high standard. You will also need to be able to work independently and to tight deadlines, dealing with the varied demands of the job. Management experience would be desirable.

Previous experience of working in the conservation field in a local authority setting is essential.
