<p>
  Introducing JKL - a lightweight boilerplate for creating a responsive Jekyll blog. Minimal styles focused on readability.
  You shouldn't have to do busy work to get going. After filling out a few small details in the config file, the only thing you need
  to do to start writing is...write. Start dropping markdown or html files into the posts directory, run Jekyll, and deploy.
</p>
<p>
  JKL is comprised of ~5kb of responsive type friendly CSS. No JS needed. When I say light, I mean light.
  It doesn't get much lighter than that.

  Typography is ace.
